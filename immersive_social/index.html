                    1870 <br>
                    Just 58 days after the start of construction, Alfred Ely Beach and his Beach Pneumatic Transit Company of New York opened a one block subway running under Broadway from Warren Street to Murray Street

                    <br><br>

                    1891 <br>
                    Piano maker William Steinway started to fund the Steinway tunnel between Manhattan and Queens through the East River

                    <br><br>
                    June 2, 1892 <br>
                    Construction for the Steinway tunnel began

                    <br><br>
                    May 22, 1894 <br>
                    The Rapid Transit Act was passed, which created the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners. This initiated the planning of one of the first full subway lines in NYC.

                    <br><br>
                    1898 <br>
                    New York, Kings and Richmond Counties, and parts of Queens and Westchester Counties and their constituent cities, towns, villages, and hamlets, were consolidated into the City of Greater New York

                    February 21, 1900 <br>
                    A contract, later known as Contract 1, was signed for the construction of the subway and a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line

                    <br><br>
                    March 24, 1900 <br>
                    Ground broke in City Hall for the subway from Contract 1

                    <br><br>
                    September 11, 1901 <br>
                    Contract 2, giving a leave of 35 years, was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company. This plan calls for an extension from City Hall to the Long Island Rail Road’s Flatbrush Avenue.

                    <br><br>
                    October 27, 1904 <br>
                    New York City's first official subway system opened in Manhattan. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) operated the 9.1-mile long subway line that consisted of 28 stations from City Hall to 145th Street and Broadway. 

                    <br><br>
                    1905 <br>
                    The IRT expands service to the Bronx

                    <br><br>
                    1906 <br>
                    Construction on Penn Station begins

                    <br><br>
                    September 24, 1907 <br>
                    The Steinway tunnel opens with demonstration trolley cars. The concession to operate the tunnels had expired on January 1, 1907, and the city of New York was unwilling to renew the contract. The city did not tolerate privately operated subways and legally prevented the IRT from operating the tunnel with the trams. So for the next five years, the tunnels, with trolley loops on both the Manhattan and Queens sides, remained inoperative.

                    <br><br>
                    1908 <br>
                    The IRT expands service to Brooklyn

                    March 19, 1913 <br>
                    The expansion of rapid transit was greatly facilitated by the signing of the Dual Contracts on March 19, 1913. Contract 3 was signed between the IRT and the city; the contract between the BRT and the city was Contract 4. The majority of the present-day subway system was either built or improved under these contracts.

                    <br><br>
                    1915 <br>
                    The IRT expands service to Queens.
                    The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company began subway service between Brooklyn and Manhattan in 1915. The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation took over a few years later.

                    <br><br>
                    September 4, 1917 <br>
                    The BRT opened the first segment of its Manhattan main line subway, the Broadway Line, as far as 14th Street – Union Square

                    The first successful train of air-conditioned subway cars, composed of ten R38 cars, goes into service on the image line. On June 24, 1975, two air-conditioned 10-car IRT trains enter service, the first air-conditioned IRT trains since the subway system opened nearly 70 years previously. This caps more than two decades of work to produce air-conditioning units small enough to fit IRT cars and powerful enough to handle a large number of customers traveling during rush hours. More than 1,300 IRT “Redbird” subway cars are retrofitted with air-conditioning until 1982. In 1983, new air-conditioned subway cars begin arriving. The entire fleet of 5,800 cars now has air-conditioning.
